## Is It Rude to Recline Your Seat on a Plane?

This repository includes a chart I created based on data from FiveThirtyEight's Flying Etiquette Survey. I picked this question from FiveThirtyEight’s Flying Etiquette Survey because it’s honestly something I’ve thought about and stressed about during flights. It’s one of those small things that seems harmless but can actually really annoy the person behind you. I wanted to see how other people feel about it and whether most think it’s rude or totally fine. What surprised me about the results is how many people do think reclining is rude, way more than I expected. 

My chart shows that the majority of respondents said “Yes,” while fewer said “No” or “Depends.” It’s interesting to see how something so common can still be so controversial. This dataset stood out to me because it takes a simple, relatable situation and opens up a conversation about social norms, travel etiquette, and how we deal with shared spaces. I really enjoyed working with it because it felt personal and relevant.
